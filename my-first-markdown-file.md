# Hello Markdown!

I'm so glad that I've finally come to know **coding**!
Like for an inline code: 'var = 7;\n'
And for a hyperlink: [Aviral Sharma's Education](aviral36.github.io/Education) 
Once you get a hang of *it*, you can
* create your own repo
* create your own company
* eventually buy Google

'Aviral Sharma'
